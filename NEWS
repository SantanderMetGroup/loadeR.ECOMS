============

* Redefinition of precipitation variable. 
  * The total precipitation amount (snow + rain) is now referred to as "pr". WFDEI now uses "pr" by default, for compatibility with model outputs. "tp" nomenclature is preserved in model data for backwards compatibility (with a warning).
* Other minor changes and on-screen message updates
